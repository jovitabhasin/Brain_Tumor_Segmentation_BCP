**Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI Scans Using Deep Learning**

***Project Overview***

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to automatically segment brain tumors from MRI scans. The model identifies the exact tumor region by generating a pixel-wise segmentation mask using a U-Net architecture.

Students will learn how to process medical imaging data, work with NIfTI files, build deep learning models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.

Weeks 1 and 2 will focus on learning python and its libraries alongewith the necessary theory required for the project. Students should start working on the problem statement from week 3 and complete by the end of week 4.
